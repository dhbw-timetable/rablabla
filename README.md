Rablabla
==============

A web application for the web based rapla timetable. It scans the DHBW timetable and offers it via a self-updating calendar server.

## Frontend

We use npm and gulp to build our frontend with ReactJS and SCSS.

Install all dependencies:
```bash
$ npm i
```
Then let the project build and start a web server:
```bash
$ npm start
```
## Backend

Currently our project does not provide an option to run Rablabla locally on your computer. But you can easily push Rablabla to a test route on your IBM Bluemix Account and let it run online. To do so you can just run:

```
$ npm run pack
```

for building a compressed frontend without running. And use the [Bluemix CLI](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/cli/index.html) to push it online.

```
$ bx cf push Rablabla-Staging -n <your-test-route> -p defaultServer
```
